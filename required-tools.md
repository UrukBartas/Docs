# ðŸ§° Required Tools

In "Uruk Bartas," we've designed the gameplay experience to be as accessible and user-friendly as possible. Unlike many other games that require extensive downloads or installations, "Uruk Bartas" requires minimal tools to get started. In fact, the only essential tool you'll need is your favorite web3 wallet.

Any wallet compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks is sufficient to play "Uruk Bartas." Since we utilize WalletConnect, a plugin that supports a wide range of wallets, you have the flexibility to choose the wallet that best suits your preferences.

Once you've selected your preferred wallet and logged in, you'll be ready to either register for the first time or continue where you left off.

While we recommend using Metamask, as it's the wallet we've extensively tested with "Uruk Bartas," other wallets are also compatible. You can download Metamask from the following link:
