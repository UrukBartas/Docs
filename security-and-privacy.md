# Security and Privacy

At Uruk Bartas, the security and privacy of our players are paramount. We take extensive measures to ensure the integrity of our platform and safeguard user information.

**Security Measures:**

All smart contracts powering Uruk Bartas have undergone thorough testing by third-party auditors, coupled with continuous monitoring through artificial intelligence-driven audits. We take pride in the results of these evaluations, as they have revealed no critical vulnerabilities.&#x20;

Any identified issues are promptly addressed, with only minor efficiency concerns remaining.

**Privacy Policy:**

Regarding privacy, we are committed to transparency and minimal data collection. The only user data we store is the email address, which is utilized solely for combat notifications and other opt-in updates in the future.&#x20;

Everything else, including personal assets and interactions within the game, is decentralized through the Web3 wallet, ensuring user privacy and control over their data.

At Uruk Bartas, we strive to provide a secure and privacy-respecting gaming environment, empowering players to enjoy their adventures with confidence and peace of mind.
